> Cinnamon is default-looking classic two column WordPress theme with a soul

## The Origin
The development of Cinnamon was started in November 2014. Cinnamon strives to be "default looking" classic two columns layout theme with a soul. Keeping familiarity of blog with enough blend of character.

## The Goals
Cinnamon is made with these goals in mind:

1. Looks great in all screen
2. Based on _s
3. Feels familiar, looks blog-ey, but has enough twist on its own
4. Ideal for blogger who blogs about his/her interests, and wants to display his/her craft.
5. in months to come (after several iteration), I personally wish that Cinnamon reaches a level where Automattic theme team would love to use it on WordPress.com

## The Theme
Here's how Cinnamon looks like:
